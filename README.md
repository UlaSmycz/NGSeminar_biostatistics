The repository with materials for NGSeminar on biostatistics (30.07). The notebook is designed to accompany a webinar, but you can run it separately for training. The webinar is recorded, so it will be available for later as well.

## About the tutor

I'm Ula and I'm a PhD at the [Department of Biostatistics and Translational Medicine](https://biostat.umed.pl/) at the Medical University of Lodz, and member of [NGSchool Society](https://ngschool.eu/).
 
## Running the tutorial materials

The easiest option is to run the notebook in Google Colab, following **[this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/UlaSmycz/NGSeminar_biostatistics/blob/master/NGSeminar_Introduction_to_biostatistics.ipynb)**. You only need to be logged in to Google account to run the code.

To run it on you own computer, you can download or clone the repository. You'll need Python 3 with quite a lot of modules. To make sure you have working version use requirements.txt file to install them:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
or
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
